ants.c consists of our original modifications to the 2017 group's codebase (ants_old.c)

Navigate to the directoryâ€™s acotsp subdirectory with $ cd acotsp.
Run $ make clean and $ make to compile the program.
Run $ ./test.sh to run the program. This command will run both the serial and parallel versions of the code.
Afterwards, run ./results.sh if you would like to see a concentrated .csv of the results. Note that the results
    for the 2017 group's implementation (the second half of results.sh) will not match the format of the first
    half of the .csv, due to not running a serial implementation (which would be redundant).
